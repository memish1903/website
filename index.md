It feels like there is no one to talk to that understands me.  
I don't even know what to expect.  
There are people people that I can talk to.  
But they can't help me, no one can.  
They don't understand. I don't know what I am doing.  
It is killing me to feel that I have nothing to look forward to.  
I think I am deeply jealous and envious. There are things I cannot have.  
Those feel like I will never have.  
It feels like I don't live, I only exist.

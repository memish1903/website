# Title </br>

It feels like there is no one to talk to that understands me.  </br>
I don't even know what to expect.  </br>
There are people people that I can talk to. </br> 
But they can't help me, no one can.  </br>
They don't understand. I don't know what I am doing. </br> 
It is killing me to feel that I have nothing to look forward to. </br> 
I think I am deeply jealous and envious. There are things I cannot have. </br> 
Those feel like I will never have.  </br>
It feels like I don't live, I only exist. </br>
